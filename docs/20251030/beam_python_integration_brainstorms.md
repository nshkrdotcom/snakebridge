# BEAM ↔ Python Integration Brainstorm (2025-10-30)

Collected ideas for deepening interoperability between the Snakepit/SnakeBridge ecosystem and Python-based teams.

## 1. Snakepit Python SDK

Goal: Let Python developers orchestrate BEAM infrastructure without leaving their runtime.

- **Session API**: `snakepit.connect()` returns a managed handle to an Elixir control plane, supporting auth,
discovery, and heartbeat.
- **Service Control**: Methods like `cluster.start_service("crucible_harness")`, `cluster.stop(service_id)`, and
`cluster.status()` to manage OTP apps remotely.
- **Job Scheduling**: Queue Crucible experiments, guardrail evaluations, or telemetry captures via
`cluster.schedule(job_spec)`, with async result polling or callbacks.
- **Streaming Interfaces**: Subscribe to telemetry/log feeds using Python async generators; re-expose BEAM
`:telemetry` data to Python observability stacks.
- **Resource Management**: Adjust pool sizes, hedging thresholds, or ensemble configurations from Python, bridging
operational knobs directly into the SDK.

## 2. Reverse Code Generation (Python Client Stubs)

Goal: Generate type-safe Python clients from SnakeBridge metadata so teams can call Elixir services naturally.

- **Schema Reuse**: Leverage the existing SnakeBridge schema cache to emit Pydantic models and dataclass clients with
identical field semantics.
- **API Surface**: Generate Python functions mirroring Elixir modules (e.g., `crucible_bench.run_test(...)`) that
serialize calls over gRPC/Snakepit.
- **Validation**: Use Pydantic validators to enforce constraints before the request hits the BEAM side, reducing
malformed traffic.
- **Docs Sync**: Produce Sphinx/Markdown snippets alongside the stubs, keeping BEAM and Python documentation aligned.

## 3. Hybrid Runtime Pipelines

Goal: Combine Python data prep with Elixir reliability workflows in a single managed pipeline.

- **Composable DAGs**: Define pipeline stages where Python handles feature engineering and Elixir handles hedging/
ensemble steps, orchestrated via Snakepit sessions.
- **Checkpoint Exchange**: Standardize artifact passing (Arrow, Parquet, Delta) so handoff between runtimes stays
zero-copy when possible.
- **Telemetry Federation**: Merge Python-side metrics (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry) with BEAM telemetry for a unified
dashboard.

## 4. Control Plane Integrations

Goal: Treat the Elixir reliability stack as an external service mesh that Python teams can plug into.

- **Kubernetes Operators**: Package OTP apps with Helm charts + Python operator hooks so DevOps can manage Crucible
clusters using familiar tooling.
- **REST/gRPC Gateways**: Ship a thin, language-agnostic gateway exposing core Crucible and LlmGuard capabilities,
with generated Python clients as first-class consumers.
- **CLI Bridge**: Provide a Python-based CLI that shells out to Elixir nodes via RPC, making it easy to script
reliability workflows in CI pipelines.

## 5. Developer Experience Enhancements

Goal: Lower friction for polyglot teams adopting the stack.

- **Tutorial Series**: “Control your BEAM reliability rig from Python” walkthroughs, showing real experiments end-
to-end.
- **Config Converters**: Translate Python YAML/JSON experiment specs into Crucible configs automatically.
- **Sample Apps**: Publish reference apps demonstrating Python frontends driving Elixir backends (e.g., Jupyter
notebooks controlling Crucible experiments).
